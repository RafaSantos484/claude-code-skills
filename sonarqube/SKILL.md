description: Use this skill whenever the user wants Claude to run a SonarQube analysis or act on its findings for a codebase — running the scanner (coverage generation plus the SonarScanner CLI via Docker), fetching issues/coverage/duplication measures through the SonarQube Web API, triaging and fixing real issues, or transitioning false positives/accepted findings. Trigger on phrases like "run SonarQube", "fix the SonarQube issues", "check code quality with SonarQube", "improve SonarQube coverage/duplication", "set up SonarQube for this project" — even when the project has no `sonar-project.properties` yet.

# SonarQube Analysis & Remediation

How to produce a SonarQube analysis for a codebase and act on what it reports:
authenticating, running the scanner, reading **Overall Code** measures, and
triaging issues into real fixes vs. transitioned false positives — for any
project, not just one repository.

This is an **opt-in** workflow. Run it only when the user explicitly asks for
a SonarQube run, a fix of SonarQube findings, or a quality-score improvement.
Never start it because a change "looks quality-related," and never fold it
into an unrelated task's validation.

Resolve these in order before touching code or the API:

1. **Auth token** — [1. Authentication](#1-authentication)
2. **Project identity** — [2. Identify the project](#2-identify-the-project)
3. **A fresh analysis** — [3. Produce a fresh analysis](#3-produce-a-fresh-analysis)
4. **Overall Code data** — [4. Fetch Overall Code measures](#4-fetch-overall-code-measures)
5. **Triage** — [5. Triage every issue before touching code](#5-triage-every-issue-before-touching-code)

## 1. Authentication

Authenticate **exclusively** through the `SONAR_TOKEN` environment variable —
a **User Token**, not a Project Analysis Token (analysis tokens can submit
scans but cannot read or transition issues).

```bash
[ -n "$SONAR_TOKEN" ] && echo present || echo missing
```

- This workflow **never** reads the token from a file — not `.env`,
  `.env.local`, CI variable files, IDE settings, or any file inside a repo —
  and never prompts for it over stdin during the API-driven workflow. It is
  expected to already be exported, globally, before the session starts.
- **Never print, log, echo, decode, or summarize the token.** Never put it in
  a URL query string (`curl -v`/`--trace` dumps headers — avoid those flags on
  authenticated calls too). Send it only in an `Authorization: Bearer
  $SONAR_TOKEN` header. Never copy it into a file, commit, test fixture, or
  message to the user.
- **If it is missing, stop.** Do not call the API, do not fall back to an
  unauthenticated request, and do not guess a token. Give the user this setup
  procedure and end the workflow:

  1. In SonarQube → avatar → **My Account** → **Security** → **Generate
     Tokens** → choose **User Token**. The account needs **Browse** and
     **Administer Issues** permission on the target project (and on every
     other project this same global token will be used for).
  2. Export it in the shell profile so every session already has it:
     ```bash
     export SONAR_TOKEN="…"
     ```
     Then open a new terminal (or `source` the profile) so it takes effect.
  3. Never put it in a project file — a global shell variable is the only
     place this workflow looks.

  Re-run the workflow once the variable is set and the shell has reloaded.

The one place a token is entered interactively is the **standalone scanner
runner** ([3. Produce a fresh analysis](#3-produce-a-fresh-analysis)), which
hides the keystrokes rather than reading it from a file.

## 2. Identify the project

**Host.** The default is `http://localhost:9000`; `SONAR_HOST_URL` overrides
it for a remote or differently-ported server. Never assume `localhost:9000`
is correct without checking `SONAR_HOST_URL` first — some setups point at a
shared or cloud instance.

**Project key.** Look for `sonar-project.properties` at the repository root
and read `sonar.projectKey=` from it — never hardcode a key guessed from the
directory name:

```bash
SONAR_PROJECT_KEY="$(sed -n 's/^sonar\.projectKey=//p' sonar-project.properties)"
SONAR_URL="${SONAR_HOST_URL:-http://localhost:9000}"
```

**No `sonar-project.properties` yet?** This is a first-time setup, not a
blocker — create a minimal one at the repo root before scanning:

```properties
sonar.projectKey=<kebab-case-name, e.g. the repo/package name>
sonar.projectName=<human-readable name>
sonar.sources=<the main source root, e.g. src>
sonar.sourceEncoding=UTF-8
```

Add a coverage report path (`sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths`,
`sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths`, …) and test/exclusion globs once you know
the stack — see `references/scanner-config.md` for language-specific keys and
the comma-splitting pitfall with brace globs. Check whether the project
already has coverage-exclusion conventions (declaration-only files with no
branch/loop/I-O) documented anywhere before inventing new ones; mirror
whatever the project's own test runner already excludes from coverage so the
two stay in agreement.

## 3. Produce a fresh analysis

Skip this step if the server already has an analysis current with the working
tree. Check concretely rather than assuming:

```bash
AUTH=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN")
LAST_REVISION="$(curl -sS "${AUTH[@]}" \
  "$SONAR_URL/api/project_analyses/search?project=$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY&ps=1" \
  | jq -r '.analyses[0].revision // empty')"
git rev-parse HEAD
```

If `LAST_REVISION` matches `git rev-parse HEAD` and `git status --porcelain` is
empty (no uncommitted changes), the server's analysis already reflects the
working tree — skip to step 4. An empty/missing `revision` (scanner run
without git present, or an old analysis predating this check) means freshness
can't be confirmed this way; re-scan rather than guess.

Otherwise:

1. **Generate a coverage report**, if the project has tests. Use whatever the
   project's own manifest already exposes for this (e.g. a `test:coverage` /
   `coverage` script in `package.json`, `pytest --cov`, `go test -cover`, …).
   Don't invent a new coverage command; find and reuse the project's existing
   one, and don't add one if none exists. Skipping this step still lets the
   scanner run — it will just report 0% coverage.
2. **Run the SonarScanner CLI via Docker** — no native install required:

   ```bash
   docker run --rm --network host \
     -e SONAR_HOST_URL -e SONAR_TOKEN \
     -v "$(pwd):/usr/src" \
     --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
     sonarsource/sonar-scanner-cli
   ```

   `-e SONAR_HOST_URL` / `-e SONAR_TOKEN` (no `=value`) forward the values
   from the **calling shell's** environment into the container without ever
   placing them in argv or `docker inspect` output. `--network host` is
   Linux-only and is what lets a `localhost:9000` server on the host be
   reachable from inside the container; it does not work under Docker Desktop
   on macOS/Windows, where the host's SonarQube must instead be reached via
   `host.docker.internal`. `--user "$(id -u):$(id -g)"` keeps files the
   scanner writes into the bind mount (`.scannerwork/`) owned by the calling
   user, not root.

   `scripts/run-scanner.sh` wraps this exact command as a
   standalone, interactive runner: it prompts for `SONAR_HOST_URL` with
   **blank input defaulting to `http://localhost:9000`** (press Enter to
   accept) and for `SONAR_TOKEN` with hidden input when neither is already
   exported, so an occasional manual run needs no prior `export`. Point the
   user at it (`bash <path-to-skill>/scripts/run-scanner.sh`, or copy it into
   the project as `scripts/sonar.sh`) when they want a repeatable local
   command instead of asking Claude to run the scan each time; when acting
   autonomously through this skill, run the `docker run` command directly with
   `$SONAR_TOKEN`/`$SONAR_HOST_URL` already resolved from the environment per
   step 1, so nothing prompts mid-task.

3. Confirm the scanner logs `EXECUTION SUCCESS` before moving on to the API
   steps — a failed scan leaves stale data on the server that step 4 would
   otherwise silently read as current.

## 4. Fetch Overall Code measures

**Use Overall Code metrics only.** Never use or prioritize New Code metrics
(`new_coverage`, `new_violations`, `new_duplicated_lines_density`, …), and
never pass `inNewCodePeriod=true` to `/api/issues/search` — New Code measures
a moving period, not the state of the codebase. Do not judge the project by
the quality-gate endpoint either: the default gate is conditioned almost
entirely on New Code, so a passing gate says nothing about Overall Code. Read
the Overall Code measures directly.

```bash
AUTH=(-H "Authorization: Bearer $SONAR_TOKEN")

# Overall Code measures
curl -sS "${AUTH[@]}" \
  "$SONAR_URL/api/measures/component?component=$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY&metricKeys=violations,coverage,uncovered_lines,duplicated_lines_density,duplicated_blocks,ncloc" \
  | jq '.component.measures'

# Open issues (no inNewCodePeriod filter — Overall Code)
curl -sS "${AUTH[@]}" \
  "$SONAR_URL/api/issues/search?components=$SONAR_PROJECT_KEY&resolved=false&ps=500" \
  | jq '.issues[] | {key, rule, severity, component, line, message}'
```

A `401`/`403` means the token is invalid or lacks permission — report that and
stop; it is not a reason to retry unauthenticated. `references/api-reference.md`
catalogs the rest of the endpoints (pagination, filtering by severity/rule/
file, hotspots) beyond the two used here.

Focus areas, in priority order: **issues**, then **test coverage**, then
**code duplication**. Full triage procedure, including how to fix vs.
transition an issue and the API calls for `do_transition`/`add_comment`, is in
`references/remediation-workflow.md` — read it before touching any issue.

## 5. Triage every issue before touching code

The short version (full detail in `references/remediation-workflow.md`):

- **Valid issue → fix the code**, following the project's own standards (its
  `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`/`CONTRIBUTING.md`/style guide if one exists — read
  it before editing). A SonarQube finding never justifies a shortcut, a
  suppression comment, or a cross-cutting refactor the user did not ask for.
  Update the project's own tests and docs alongside the fix, as its
  conventions require.
- **False positive or not worth changing → transition it via the API, leave
  the code alone.** Never edit source purely to silence a finding.
- **Always record why** with `add_comment` so the decision survives the next
  analysis, and report every transition to the user with its justification.
- **Improve coverage/duplication only where genuinely justified** — no
  placeholder tests, no speculative extractions just to move a number.
- **Re-run validation** (the project's own lint/typecheck/test/build commands)
  after any code change, then re-scan and re-read Overall Code measures to
  confirm the findings actually moved.

## Reference files

- `references/remediation-workflow.md` — the full triage procedure: deciding
  fix vs. transition, the `do_transition`/`add_comment` calls, coverage and
  duplication guidance, and the re-validation loop.
- `references/api-reference.md` — SonarQube Web API catalog: measures, issue
  search/filtering, transitions, comments, hotspots, pagination.
- `references/scanner-config.md` — writing or extending
  `sonar-project.properties` for a given language/stack, and the
  brace-glob-splits-on-commas pitfall.
- `scripts/run-scanner.sh` — standalone interactive runner: prompts for
  `SONAR_HOST_URL` (blank → `http://localhost:9000`) and hidden `SONAR_TOKEN`
  when unset, then runs the Docker scanner command from step 3.
